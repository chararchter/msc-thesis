Multilingual intention detection is important for virtual assistants, and customer-service automation is becoming more cost-effective and relevant. One way of detecting intent is mapping input text strings to multidimensional vector space, which is used by intent classification models to supply users with the information they need. This thesis focuses on training a variety of machine learning models and comparing different approaches, such as mapping input text to multingual word embeddings and machine translating input text to English and using English corpus-based word embeddings for intent detection.
