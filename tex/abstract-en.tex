Multilingual intention detection is important for virtual assistants, and customer-service automation is becoming more cost-effective and relevant. Input text strings are mapped to multidimensional vector space, which is used by intent classification models to supply users with the information they need. The work is on training a variety of machine learning models and comparing different approaches, such as mapping input text to multingual word embeddings or machine translating input text to English and using English corpus-based word embeddings for intent detection.
