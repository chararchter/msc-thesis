    abstract="This paper describes a prototype system for partial automation of customer service operations of a mobile telecommunications operator with a human-in-the loop conversational agent. The agent consists of an intent detection system for identifying the types of customer requests that it can handle appropriately, a slot filling information extraction system that integrates with the customer service database for a rule-based treatment of the common scenarios, and a template-based language generation system that builds response candidates that can be approved or amended by customer service operators. The main focus of this paper is on the system architecture and machine learning system structure design, and the observations of a limited pilot study performed to evaluate the proposed system on customer messages in Latvian. We also discuss the business requirements and practical application limitations and their influence on the design of the natural language processing components.",

    abstract="We expect to interact with home assistants irrespective of our language. However, scaling the Natural Language Understanding pipeline to multiple languages while keeping the same level of accuracy remains a challenge. In this work, we leverage the inherent multilingual aspect of translation models for the task of multilingual intent classification and slot filling. Our experiments reveal that they work equally well with general-purpose multilingual text-to-text models. Furthermore, their accuracy can be further improved by artificially increasing the size of the training set. Unfortunately, increasing the training set also increases the overlap with the test set, leading to overestimating their true capabilities. As a result, we propose two new evaluation methods capable of accounting for an overlap between the training and test set.",

    abstract={Dialogue systems are becoming an ubiquitous presence in our everyday lives having a huge impact on business and society. Spoken language understanding (SLU) is the critical component of every goal-oriented dialogue system or any conversational system. The understanding of the user utterance is crucial for assisting the user in achieving their desired objectives. Future-generation systems need to be able to handle the multilinguality issue. Hence, the development of conversational agents becomes challenging as it needs to understand the different languages along with the semantic meaning of the given utterance. In this work, we propose a multilingual multitask approach to fuse the two primary SLU tasks, namely, intent detection and slot filling for three different languages. While intent detection deals with identifying userâ€™s goal or purpose, slot filling captures the appropriate user utterance information in the form of slots. As both of these tasks are highly correlated, we propose a multitask strategy to tackle these two tasks concurrently. We employ a transformer as a shared sentence encoder for the three languages, i.e., English, Hindi, and Bengali. Experimental results show that the proposed model achieves an improvement for all the languages for both the tasks of SLU. The multi-lingual multi-task (MLMT) framework shows an improvement of more than 2% in case of intent accuracy and 3% for slot F1 score in comparison to the single task models. Also, there is an increase of more than 1 point intent accuracy and 2 points slot F1 score in the MLMT model as opposed to the language specific frameworks.}

    abstract="This paper shows that pretraining multilingual language models at scale leads to significant performance gains for a wide range of cross-lingual transfer tasks. We train a Transformer-based masked language model on one hundred languages, using more than two terabytes of filtered CommonCrawl data. Our model, dubbed XLM-R, significantly outperforms multilingual BERT (mBERT) on a variety of cross-lingual benchmarks, including +14.6{\%} average accuracy on XNLI, +13{\%} average F1 score on MLQA, and +2.4{\%} F1 score on NER. XLM-R performs particularly well on low-resource languages, improving 15.7{\%} in XNLI accuracy for Swahili and 11.4{\%} for Urdu over previous XLM models. We also present a detailed empirical analysis of the key factors that are required to achieve these gains, including the trade-offs between (1) positive transfer and capacity dilution and (2) the performance of high and low resource languages at scale. Finally, we show, for the first time, the possibility of multilingual modeling without sacrificing per-language performance; XLM-R is very competitive with strong monolingual models on the GLUE and XNLI benchmarks. We will make our code and models publicly available.",

	abstract={The past 3 years of work in NLP have been characterized by the development and deployment of ever larger language models, especially for English. BERT, its variants, GPT-2/3, and others, most recently Switch-C, have pushed the boundaries of the possible both through architectural innovations and through sheer size. Using these pretrained models and the methodology of fine-tuning them for specific tasks, researchers have extended the state of the art on a wide array of tasks as measured by leaderboards on specific benchmarks for English. In this paper, we take a step back and ask: How big is too big? What are the possible risks associated with this technology and what paths are available for mitigating those risks? We provide recommendations including weighing the environmental and financial costs first, investing resources into curating and carefully documenting datasets rather than ingesting everything on the web, carrying out pre-development exercises evaluating how the planned approach fits into research and development goals and supports stakeholder values, and encouraging research directions beyond ever larger language models.},

One of the reasons for the current hype is the fact that chatbots (one particularly popular form of conversational interfaces) nowadays can be created without any programming knowledge, thanks to different toolkits and so-called Natural Language Understanding (NLU) services. While these NLU services are already widely used in both, industry and science, so far, they have not been analysed systematically. In this paper, we present a method to evaluate the classification performance of NLU services. Moreover, we present two new corpora, one consisting of annotated questions and one consisting of annotated questions with the corresponding answers. Based on these corpora, we conduct an evaluation of some of the most popular NLU services. Thereby we want to enable both, researchers and companies to make more educated decisions about which service they should use.",
